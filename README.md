# CPPOregonTrail
Inspired by https://github.com/jefftasticgames/school-projects/blob/main/oregon.py, easily portable to other platforms.

### Features
- Incredibly abstracted (the game code makes no use of standard functions but rather wrappers for them!)
- Is able to handle multiple sessions if you have more than one input/output stream.
